This package is based on the following packages.  These must be installed before 
this package can be compiled.

1.  You will need a copy of antelope, which is commercial software available from http://brtt.com.
antelope is available for all US Universities to support seismology research.  The
agreement and instruction to download can be found here:
http://brtt.com/education_and_academic_research.html

2. Since version 5.5 of Antelope BRTT does not distribute the contributed code with a new release.
It must be obtained and built seperately.  The install gui currently has a button to build contrib
automatically.  If you need to do this manually see the instruction found at this URL:
http://antelopeusersgroup.org/repository/

3.  The package depends upon the serialization library in the open source boost library.  
Downlaod the package from http:://boost.org.  Much of boost is templates only, but this package 
depends upon the serialization library that must be compiled.  See the boost web pages for 
instructions on how to build this and other libraries in the package.  In my experience it is
preferable to override the default install location (/usr/local) using the --prefix argument
on their bootstrap.sh configuration script.  I recommend /opt/boost to mesh clealy with antelope's
install path.

4. Some of the programs in this library depend upon the monster open-sourcelibrary called vtk.  
On linux you need to download and build the package according to instructions on the vtk web
site:  http://www.vtk.org/.   On a Mac it is far far easier to build the package using fink or
macports.   

The build structure for this package uses the same mechanism as Antelope contrib.   
In fact, the entire package could have been placed in contrib but I elected to split
these out as separate programs that might have a different audience than the antelope contrib.
Before the package can be built you will need to become familiar with the custom and
rather unusual way that antelope handles open source packages like boost.   This requires
only three steps:
1.   Make sure you noted where you installed boost and vtk.  

2.   If you have not already done so make sure you put this line in your shell initialization 
script.   
For bash/sh:
source /opt/antelope/5.5/setup.sh  # note 5.5 is version number, change for later releases
For csh/tcsh:
source /opt/antelope/5.5/setup.csh  # note 5.5 is version number, change for later releases

3. Run localmake_config.  In the gui select the button for boost, enter the information for
BOOSTINCLUDE and BOOSTLIB, and push the enable button.   Repeat for vtk.   The gui will tell
you if you entered these correctly.   When you get everything write select File->save and when
instructed push the button to save the configuration.

4.  Return to the directory where you found this file and just type:
make Include
make install

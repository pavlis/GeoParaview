This files describes steps required for installing the plane wave migration package
called pwmig.   

1.  Decide where you want to put the top level directory for this package.
The default is /opt/pwmig/XXX where XXX is a version number tag.  This should
normally be in the user who will maintain this package's account and owned by 
a regular user.   I do not recommend this package be installed as root.  If
other people need to use the package, make sure the directory you choose for the
installation is readable by others.

2.  edit the file setup/setup.csh to set the location you chose above.  

3.  In the setup directory run make.  This will create the directories for 
different components of the package.   

4.  In a terminal cd to the pwmig directory and run make

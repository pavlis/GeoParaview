.SH NAME
glob \- c-callable glob routine 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
char ** glob ( char *globpattern );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine takes a "glob" pattern (like the c-shell), and
returns a sorted list of the files which match that pattern.
The pattern may contain
.BR * ,
.BR ? ,
.B [
or
.BR { ,
or begin with
.BR \*~ .
The meaning of these characters is as follows:
.TP 15
.B *
Match any (zero or more) characters.
.TP
.B ?
Match any single character.
.TP
.BR [ " .\|.\|. " ]
Match any single character in the enclosed list(s) or range(s).
A list is a string of characters. 
A range is two characters separated by a minus-sign
.RB ( \- ),
and includes all the characters in between in the
.SM ASCII
collating sequence (see
.BR ascii (7)).
.HP
.B {
.IB str ,
.IB str ,
\&.\|.\|.
.B }
.br
Expand to each string (or filename-matching pattern) in the
comma-separated list.
Unlike the pattern-matching expressions above, the expansion of this
construct is not sorted.
For instance,
.B {b,a}
expands to
.RB ` b '
.RB ` a ',
(not
.RB ` a '
.RB ` b ').
As special cases, the characters
.BR {
and
.BR } ,
along with the string
.BR {\|} ,
are passed undisturbed.
.TP
\fB\~ [\fIuser\fB]
Your home directory, or that of
.IR user ,
as indicated by the password entry.
.LP
Only the patterns
.BR * , " ?"
and
.BR [ .\|.\|. ]
imply pattern matching.
The
.RB ` . '
(dot character),
when it is the first character in a filename or pathname
component, must be matched explicitly.
The
.B /
(slash)
must also be matched explicitly.

.SH EXAMPLE
.nf

    #include "stock.h"

    int
    main(argc, argv)
    int             argc;
    char          **argv;
    {
        char **results ; 
        char aline[STRSZ] ;

        while ( gets(aline) ) 
            {
            printf ( "%s :\en", aline ) ; 
            results = glob ( aline ) ; 
            while ( results && *results ) 
                {
                printf ( "\et%s\en", *results ) ; 
                free (*results) ;
                results++ ; 
                }
            }
        return 0;
    }

.nf
.SH RETURN VALUES
Returns a list (vector) of malloc'd character strings, or 0 if
there are no matches.  The end of the list is marked with
a null string.

# This file describes a pattern replacement algorithm for
# mapping SunOS automounted directories to their equivalent
# "canonical" form.  

# This should be entirely unnecessary for 
# Solaris, as the Solaris automounter has some different algorithm
# and pwd under solaris actually returns the path used to access
# a file or directory.

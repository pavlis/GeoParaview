Attribute coherence
	Real (7)
	Format ( "%7.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.0" )
	Range ( "coherence>=0.0 && coherence<=1.0" )
	Description ( "coherence" )
	Detail {
		Coherence is a measure of waveform similarity commonly used in many 
signal processing algorithms.
	}
	;

Attribute semblance
	Real (7)
	Format ( "%7.3f" )
	Null ( "-1.0" )
	Range ( "semblance>=0.0 && semblance<=1.0" )
	Description ( "semblance" )
	Detail {
		Semblance is a measure of waveform similarity commonly used stacking.
	}
	;

Attribute gridid
        Integer (8)
        Format ( "%8d" )
        Null ( "-1" )
        Range ( "gridid > 0" )
        Description ( "grid id index" )
        Detail {
		Spatial grids are conveniently indexed with a single
		integer.  This allows the structure of the grid to be
		defined as desired.  This index is also a convenient
		key if the grid is defined in a database table instead
		of being stored on disk.
        }
        ;

Attribute pchan
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Processing channel code" )
	Detail {
		This is a processing channel code that may or may not match the more 
common chan attribute.  It is intended most to denote  generic channel after resampling 
and/or coordinate reorientation.  The expected codes are Z,N,E,L,R,T,H, and 3C but the 
range is not currently restricted to these.
	}
	;

Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}
	;

Attribute fold
	Integer (4)
	Format ( "%4d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "fold > 0" )
	Description ( "number of elements used in a stack" )
	Detail {
		In stacking data we commonly used the word fold to denote the number of 
members stacked to produce an average estimate.
	}
	;

Relation stackstats
	Fields ( sta pchan gridid phase pwfid fold coherence semblance lddate )
	Primary ( sta pchan gridid )
	Description ( "Table for vertical stacking methods" )
	Detail {
		RFeventstacker computes vertical stacks from virtual sources.  This table is
		used to store stacking statistics in that program, but could be used
		by any vertical stacking method.
	}

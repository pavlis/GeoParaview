This application has an optional plotting mode with matlab.  
Compile with Makefile.matlab to get plotting features enabled.  Otherwise just type make

run this application requires this evil construct on my laptop:
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH /Applications/MATLAB_R2009a.app/bin/maci

This is the Mac equivalent of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Do not use this unless you get symbol loading 
errors with the matlab engine library.

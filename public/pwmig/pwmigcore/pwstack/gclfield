        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Name attached to a coordinate grid mesh" )
        Detail {
                Several contexts require geographical 2d or 3d 
		grids.  This attribute ties a name to a name to 
		a grid that is a useful key for many tables defining
		such an entity.

Attribute fieldname
	String (15)
        Format ( "%-15s" )
        Null ( "-" )
        Description ( "Name attached to a gclfield" )
        Detail {
                Several contexts require geographical 2d or 3d 
		grids.  We call some physical quantity tied to 
		a GCLgrid a field.  This attribute defines the name
		attached to that field quantity.

	Format ( "%3d" )
	Null ("0")
	Range ( "dimensions > 0" )
	Description ("Number of dimensions" )
	Detail {
		Graphical objects multidimensional.  This parameter
		defines the number of dimensions in the object.  
		It is normally 2 or 3.

Attribute nv
	Integer (4)
	Format ( "%4d")
	Null ("-1")
	Range ( "nv >= 0" )
	Description ( "Number of elements in a vector" )
	Detail {
		Geographical curvilinear grids define vector field
		objects.  This defines the number of components of
		vectors stored in a vector field.
	}
	;

Relation gclfield
	Fields (

	Primary ( gridname fieldname )
	Description ( "GCLgrid field object attribute table" )
	Detail {
		This relation defines parameter information for data fields
		defined on GCLgrid objects.   This is used for an external 
		representation of these objects.

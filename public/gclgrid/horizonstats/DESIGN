Purpose of this program is a quick and dirty estimate of amplitude variations 
in migration solutions at 410 and 660 discontinuities.  Need to quantify 
this for xin's paper.  This is part 1 of a series of things that might be 
useful to improve that work.

This program will simply compute rms, and median absolute deviation of 
values in a depth window.

Input should be lat,lon,depth points were stats are desired.  
this should allow use on a more than just the 410 problem.  e.g. it could
be used to measure amplitude variations on what I'm calling the top of the 
Farllon slab or by Bauer in Alaska.

usage should be 

horizonstats db gridname fieldname [-pf pffile] < inlist 

write to stdout 
lon, lat, depmin, depthcenter, depthmax, Rrms, R_MAD, Trms, T_MAD, 3Crms, 3C_MAD

where R is radial, T is transverse, and 3C means sum of all 3 components

Future step after this is to try fitting a single wavelet curve to seismogram
extracted at each point.

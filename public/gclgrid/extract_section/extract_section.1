.SH NAME
extract_section - extract a cross-section from a 3D object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
extract_section db gridname fieldname [-pf pffile -o outfile -vectordata]
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program extracts a cross section through fields stored in 
GCLscalarfield3d and GCLvectorfield3d objects.  The cross-section
is specified as a set of 2 or more ordered pairs of latitude and
longitudes.  The field volume referenced is then sliced vertically
on the path defined by the set of ordered pairs that define the 
section.  The output is always an equally sampled interpolation of 
the parent volue through a specified path.  i.e. the output can
always be treated as a matrix with the column index defining the
x coordinate and the row index defining the depth coordinate.
By default the data that define the section are pushed
to standard output.  
.LP
This program is driven by a mix of command line arguments and parameters 
defined through a parameter file.  The following are required arguments:
.LP
\fIdb\fR is the database that was used to store the field data from
which the requested section is to be extracted.
.LP
\fIgridname\fR is the named used to tag the GCLgrid3d that defines
the geometry of the field data to be extracted.  
\fIfieldname\fR is the named used to tag the field variable.  Note
this uses extension table gclfield and gclgdisk that are used to 
index the files containing these objects.  The combination of 
gridname and fieldname are unique keys used to find a particular
instance of a 3d field object.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -pf
This allows pffile to be used as an alternative to the standard
name of extract_section.
.IP -o 
Writes results to outfile instead of stdout.  
.IP -vectordata
is a flag to inform the program to expect the input field to 
be a vector field.  By default it assumes the field holds only
scalar data.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
.LP
\fIoutput_format\fR must be one of three options:  (1) dmatrix;
(3) SEISMICUNIX; 
or (2) GMT (gmt is also accepted).  The dmatrix format writes the results
as a ascii numbers in a table with spaces separating the fields.  
This matrix can, for example, be read into matlab with the 
dlmread command.  The SEISMICUNIX format writes the results as a 
SEISMICUNIX (SU) SEGY file.  SU format is a simplified SEGY.  
The file contains no "reel" headers (SEGY has two file headers not
written here) and the data samples are always written in host floating
point format. The GMT format 
writes the results in a format suitable
as input to the GMT command pswiggle.  
.LP
\fIgeographic_output\fR is a boolean used to control the 
format for gmt format output.  When false (the default) 
data are output in a cartesian coordinate set of x (along section
distance), z (depth), and value.  When true the output format is
latitude, longitude, depth, and value.  
.LP
\fIpath_sample_interval\fR is the sampling interval 
(in km) of the volume
along the x (along path) coordinate. 
.LP
\fIdepth_sample_interval\fR is the sampling interval (in km)
in depth.  
.LP
\fImaximum_depth\fR is the maximum depth (in km) to sample.
If the input volume does not extend this deep the final point in the
volume is extended downward.  Thus, in this situation you can expect
a constant region at depths between the actual bottom of the volume
and this depth.
.LP
\fIminimum_depth\fR is the minimum depth (in km) to sample.  
As with the maximum depth if this extends above the volume the 
output will be filled with the top value of the field at the 
latitude and longitude of the given point.
.LP
\fIcomponent_number\fR in vector field data this is the component
that is extracted as output. This parameter is ignored or scalar
fields.
.LP
\fIsection_points\fR is a Tbl that contain the set of ordered
pairs that define the section line.  An example should make this
clearer:
.nf
section_points &Tbl{
8.0 -66.0
10.0 -66.0
12.0 -67.0
}
.fi
This defines the section through two line segments.  The first 
runs from latitude 8.0 and longitude -66 to latitude 10.0 
and longitude -66.  The section then runs from the (10.0,-66) 
point to (12.0,-67.0).  There is no limit on the number of 
points, but paths with points closer than the horizontal sample
interval are almost certainly trouble.  Corners are also rounded
by a simple nearest integer formula so complex paths are subject
to serious rounding problems. 
.LP
\fIuse_points_directly\fR is a boolean that controls how the section_points
values are handled.  Normally the program interpolates between the section
points to produce an equally spaced sequence of points.  When this 
boolean is set true (the default is false) the section_points are used
directly to define the output points.  
.SH FILES
.LP
The output format depends on the setting 
of the \fIoutput_format\fR parameter.
.LP
\fIdmatrix\fR format is a simple ascii table output of the
section matrix.  i.e. each line is one row of the section
matrix with the elements separated by the ascii space character.  
.LP
\fIGMT\fR format is normally in a format suitable as input to
pswiggle.  When the geographic_output parameter is set true, 
however, the output normally needs to be reformatted with
awk to be of any use.  Thus gmt format in combination with 
geographic_output should be viewed as recommended only 
for advanced users who know both gmt and the ins and outs
of awk.  See the man page for pswiggle to learn more about
this format.
.LP
\fISEISMICUNIX\fR creates a binary seismic unix format file as output.
A fixed set of header values are set.  Run surange to see what is
set.  SU has a way to flag samples as depth samples, but this has
not been implemented.  Instead the scaling is really odd because 
segy writes the sample interval as an int16_t header value with units
of microseconds.  This makes rational units difficult since 1 km, 
for example, would overflow an int16_t if used for dt.  To get
something close to normal scales for seismic currently dz is scale
by 1000.  Thus, for example, if dz is 1 km, the output will look
like seismic data with a sample interval of 1 ms.  
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
The program will die with a hopefully explanatory message with
inconsistent input or reading problems.
.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.LP (1)
The algorithm used to pass through a corner of a section 
path is not very sophisticated.  Roundoff errors should be
expected at each corner.  i.e. the x coordinate after a
corner can be off by a significant fraction of the horizontal
sampling interval because the jump across the segments is 
controlled only by a nearest integer scheme. 
.IP (2)
The way dt is handled is really ugly.  Ultimately, I need to figure
out how SU handles the switch from time to depth scaling.  This uses
a special field in the extra part of the standard header.

The files in the repository are sufficent to crack the 2015 mit model completely. 
Scott supplied a set of matlab scripts in the electronic supplement to the paper
on this model that are intimately linked to the reformat m file found here.   

To run this you need to take apart the tar file with the model and matlab code.
Copy the file reformatMIT2015.m to the to level directory of that tar file and
run it with matlab.   It should produce the output file MIT2015.txt.   

Then run convertMIT15 redirecting MIT2015.txt as the input.  

For use with pwmig I recommend the -slow flag, but note that requires a (frozen name)
file called ak135.mod1d.   pwmig can use the same file.   There is a converter
program to read the data filel supplied from the download site to ak135.mod1d

.SH NAME
mesh_surface - build a 3d regular mesh from irregular data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
meshsurface ingrid outf [-af fname -pf pffile]< pointfile
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The original GCLgrid library was limited to a structured 2D grid in 
3D space.   Type example in 3D visualization is a flag represented by
a regular mesh.   Frequently in geosciences we have only irregularly 
sampled data to represent a surface.   The basic idea of this program
is to build a gridded surface in 3D from irregularly spaced data.  
This program can be thought of as a 3D version of the bicubic spline
program called surface and the 
Delaunay triangularization programs called triangulate in GMT.  
The output is a GCLscalarfield object with depth as the scalar attribute.
.LP
\fIingrid\fR is a base file name for a GCLgrid object that defines the 
lat and lon grid used for gridding.   That is, only the latitude 
and longitude coordinates are extracted from this grid.   
Depth is interpolated from pointfile data (see below).  
Note this program only supports the file based constructors for a 
GCLgrid.   That usually means that exportgrid needs to be run on a 
base grid created with makegclgrid and stored in an antelope db.  
Similar outf is the base file for the output GCLscalarfield file.   
By default the field data stored with the grid is the depth in km to the 
surface the grid defines.   Use the -af flag (see below) to set a different attribute.
.LP
The pointfile is a simple text file with standard unix white space 
delimited field.  Each line is assumed to contain a point defined
by longitude (degrees), latitude (degrees), and depth (km).   
The code parses the first 3 token and drops trailing text.  Hence
comments on points can appear as text following the depth field.  
Comments should still be preceded by the # symbol.
The points in this file define the points that are interpolated to form the mesh.
.LP
Note that if triangularization is used data outside the convex hull
of the input points will be undefined.   Points outside the hull are flagged with a large
negative number (-99999.9).  Normally such data should be passed
through the build_masked_surface program(1) to turn the result into a 
form that can be correctly viewed in paraview.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP -af fname
This option is used to define an attribute other than depth as the field variable
for the output GCLscalarfield object.  fname is assumed to be a text file similar
to the pointfile input but the depth field is replaced by the desired attribute.   
That is, each line should be:  longitude(deg), latitude(deg), and attribute value.
The same interpolation method used to compute depth on the regular output grid will
be applied to these data.  This was designed originally for the output of PETREL
where attribute and depths have to be written as separate point files.   
.IP -pf
Use pffile instead of the default mesh_grid.pf.
.SH FILES
.LP
The point file read from stdin is white space delimited text
in the order latitude, longitude, and depth.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
.IP (1)
Be careful of the warnings given in gmt's surface program man page
and the paper referenced there on the tension parameters.  
Tension needs to be 1 if the data have large local gradients that
define an edge.   With smoother attributes they recommend 0.25.
.IP (2)
I also use Lindquist's Delaunay triangulization routine.  It works well
in most cases but I have seen this routine go into an infinite loop.
This seems to be related to a known issue with Delaunay triangulization 
with multiple colinear points.   Lindquist's function does not seem to
handle this issue.   It is unclear if there is a true infinite loop
or the compute time in some cases is just extremely long.   The former
seems likely as I've let this code run for hours with a few hundred 
points and it did not finish.

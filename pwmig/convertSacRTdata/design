These are my design notes.  Purpose here is to take data from another, in this
case Fenglin but anticipating same issues for EARS data, and convert results
back 3c sets in cardinal directions.   For now here are some assumptions

1.  Data are indexed with a wfdisc table.
2.  only R and T data are in defined.  Will need a way to map these to sitechan seed chan codes.  
3.  chan codes will not match raw data channel codes.  
4.  Data are all at a common sample rate.  If not we can run dbresample to make it so.
We'll not test this as the data I have from Fenglin has irregular rates computed
somehow that are close to 20 sps.
5.  We'll have to associate with origins to get rotation angles.  This needs to be
computed as we should not depend on assoc to hold this information.

Some things I'm not sure to make this more useful down the road, but which 
are true for now

1.  Channels are all BHR  assume BHT if we get added components from Fenglin
2.  Start times on these traces are bogus.  They are only approximately right
anyway.  I think I'll be ok within time interval join limits.  i.e. I think 
I can join correctly in all cases with P as it will still overlap with 
waveforms.

Here is some pseudocode for the algorithm:

1) crack command line (dbin dbout [-pf pffile])
2) open db
3) load metadata lists for input and output from pf
4) parse control for channel mapping 
5) create dbh as view joining event, origin, assoc, arrival 
6) foreach row in dbh
	7) Load data including origin info (note when T data available will need to load 2 traces)
	8) stuff data into a 3c trace object
	9) create Hypocenter from origin view
	10) compute bearing
	11) call rotate method for 3c trace object.
	12) dbsave 3c trace object to output db (pwmig schema using wfprocess)

/*! \brief Handle to a temp file used in grid stacking.

Three-dimensional grids contain very large amounts of data
that may not fit in a computer's memory.  This object is 
intimately linked to the grid stacking program and is used
to provide a faster mechanism to access member grids than
a database.  This is useful in that program as robust stacking
requires multiple passes through the data.  

The basic concept behind this object is to abstract the process 
of getting data from the scratch file.  The constructor creates
the object by loading all the data from a list of grids into 
the scratch file.  The idea is that once this object is created
a program can work through the scratch file requesting one object
at a time.  This is a general concept of common use in data processing
and there are reasons to think it could be a useful template.  
For now it is a concrete thing for 3d grid objects specialized to 
this particular program.

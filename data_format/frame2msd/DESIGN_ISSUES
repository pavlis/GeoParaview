Initial design discussion meeting held Oct 9, 2010, at CIT

Question by glp:
1.  We need to figure out a mechanism to map whatever data concept is used
in the frames library defining a particular channel of data to the dogmatic SEED requirement of net:sta:chan:loc

2.  What is the file layout used?  i.e. are the individual data files large or small?  Protype usage design for the conversion program would be:

frame2msd < framefile > mseedfile

If framefile is large we may want to write mseed files out one channel at a time for easier reorganization to day volumes (show miniseed2days program).  

3.  How do we handle time tags?  miniseed tags every packet so issue is avoiding time tears across sequential files.

/* This library is designed to parse a pf stream for use mainly in data-driven, parallel
processing algorithms.  A pf stream is a stream of parameter file type blocks of 
metadata separated by a keyword defined in pfstream.h.  That is, each block of
ascii characters between the keyword sentinel is assumed to consist of keywords and
numbers as used in antelope parameter files.  

The format has two modes.  A single object mode will call pfcompile on each block of
text bounded by the input separator keyword.  In "ensemble" mode, the block of text 
is assumed to be in this structure:
ensemble &Arr{
---- constant parameters for this ensemble----
000001 &Arr {
--parameter for object 1----
}
000002 &Arr {
--parameters for object 2---
}
repeat for n objects

}

This file contains basic input and output functions for a pfstream.

/* This is a low level read routine that sucks in data from file fname 
until the  end of block line (symbol ENDPF_SENTINEL defined in pfstream.h)
is read.  It then closes the file to allow another process to access the
file under an assuption that fname is a fifo.  Finally, 
pfcompile is then called and the resulting pfobject is returned.

The algorithm is more complicated than one might think it needs to be because
the size of the input block of text is not predictable.  With the structure
of parameter file descriptions it is necessary to suck in the whole file
before trying to interpret it.  As a result the algorithm uses an initial
buffer size which grows as needed whenever the previous read gets close to 
a high water mark.  There may be a more elegant way to do this with some
alternative function, but I don't know about it.  

RETURNS:
normal return is a valid pointer to a pf.  A NULL pointer indicates 
a failure in pfcompile.  The function will die if memory allocation fails.

/* This routine takes apart an ensemble pf description and returns a vector of
pf objects for the components of the ensemble.  (see above).  It should always
be called after a read function (pfstream_read above, pfread, or extracting pf's
from an orb) to take the parameter ensemble apart.  

The algorithm has some built in assumptions that the pieces of the ensemble
are tagged by 6 digit numbers that start at 000000.  6 digits are surely 
overkill, but given the way memory is going it may not be so silly.  The are
taken apart in the order Arr returns them in to build Tbl containing pointers
to pf objects of the components of the ensemble.  That is, the ith pf object
from this ensemble can be extracted from the output tbl, t, with a call like this:
pf=(Pf *)gettbl(t,i)

This structure, although complex, was done by design as it allows a complete
ensemble to be encapsulated in a single pf object.  This simplifies and 
abstracts the process of reading from a fifo or from an orb.  i.e. calls
to functions that do quite different things can yield the same result.
This could be overloaded in C++ if I wanted to go that route. 

Multiple ensembles can be enscapsulated in one block of data passed
through a pfstream.  Each ensemble (table) is preceded by a keyword
passed as the argument "tag".  This allows multiple tables to be 
passed down the same input stream which could, in principle, be
reconstituted into a relational form with something like datascope
using internal, temporary databases.  This is not implemented here though.

Note that the input Pf object, pf, is only accessed to take apart the 
components of the "ensemble &Arr{...}" component of Pf.  If there are other parameters
in pf outside the range of this object the caller needs to handle these
separately.  Further note that if multiple tables are embeddged in on
pfstream this function has to be called separately for each table
defined by "tag".

Normal returns is a pointer to the Pf_ensemble object.  A NULL pointer
is returned if cracking the complex pf defined by the ensemble failed.

IT is worth clarifying here the gross structure of a multiple table
group of data received through a stream.  Suppose we had an origin 
and assoc table grouping passed as one block.  The controlling structure
 of the Pf would be:

origin &Arr{
ensemble_keys &Tbl{
orid
}
ensemble &Arr{
000001 &Arr{
data
}
000002 &Arr{
more data
}
...
}
assoc &Arr{
ensemble_keys &Tbl{
arid
orid
}
ensemble &Arr{
000001 &Arr{
data
}
000002 &Arr{
more data
}
...
}

}

/* this is the reciprocal of pfget_Pf_ensemble.  Basically it compiles
the pieces of a Pf_ensemble into a single pf object with a keyword
that identifies the block defined by the input variable tag.  

This is a large memory algorithm that works in a brute force way.  pf2string is
used to expand each of the components, the components are combined by string
manipulation, and the results are converted by to a pf by pfcompile.  
Note use of variable arguments to allow tables with multiple tags to be
pushed into the same pf object.

Arguments:
ntags - dummy required to implement variable arguments.  Standard
	C's implementation of variable args does not allow 
	a null start argument.  This defines the number of triplet 
	arguments that are expected to follow.  Since we are stuck
	with it anyway this avoids things like terminating 0 arg used
	in routines like dbgetv.

This function uses a variable argument list made up of triplets
in the following order:  [tag, ensemble_pf, pfe] where
	tag - name used to tag the output Arr.
	ensemble_pf - (optional) set of parameters to dump at head
		of output stream that is build here.  That is these
		are global parameters.  This should be set to NULL
		before calling this function if no global parameters
		are required.
		Note that if the grouping features is used this block
		must contain those parameters.
	pfe - Pf_ensemble that is to be compiled into single output pf

	[tag2, pfe2, ... ] repeat for additional tables (variable arg)

/* This is the routine that uses data pushed onto the queue by the

pfh is the control structure returned by the read thread we use
to access the data contained in the fifo.

Returns a NULL to signal end of data.  This can happen one of two ways.
If there is an error in pmtfifo_pop, complain is called and we return NULL.
This was done to allow a graceful exit from the caller.  The warning message
may be too subtle, but I see now simple way to do this with plain C.  This
is a case where I can see reasons for C++'s throw having a big advantage.
The function will also return NULL when it sees the end of data.  
That is caught here by the FINISHED boolean in the pf.

example, to initialize a grid defining a 3d velocity model with a 1d velocity model background.
When an externally defined model is then registered on the grid unfilled points can have a default
value of the 1d background.  This is common, for example, when trying to define an externally produced
model on a different grid geometry.

interpolated values from the scale, 1d model defined by the input vectors val1d and
z1d.  Note that the order of z1d is expected to be backwards from the grid.  This is
because the grid (see man gclgrid(3)) requires that the x3 component be arranged from
the deepest depth upward while 1d earth model convention universally start at the surface.
This complicates the algorithm, but should be transparent to the user provided the
input recognizes this. */

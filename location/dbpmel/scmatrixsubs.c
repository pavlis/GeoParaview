/* Creates an associative array of column index positions using
pattern from associative array of Station structures keyed by sta name.
The order will be controlled by what keysarr gives.  Note we use 
pointers to int to store column indexes because getarr from this 
array signals a error with a NULL.  If we used an int I can't see 
how we could tell this from 0, which is a valid column index and
will, in fact, always be in the resultant.  

Arguments:
	sa - associative array of Station * that are counted to
		produce output indices.

Returns an associative array keyed by station names that hold
indices to column positions.  These are basically count order
from sa input.

/* Creation routine for an SCMatrix structure used internally 
as the working internal object of pmel.  It defines static 
sizes and indices that define the columns of the working matrix.
It then allocs memory for the working vectors of station correction
(path anomalies) that are the major outputs of pmel.  The initial
working S matrix is created, but it's size is set to 1 row.  This
assumes that later on this space will be realloced to match variable
data size for different event groups that are processed.  That is
the number of data in a group is variable, but the station list and
phase list that define the column structure of S are static through
a single run of pmel. 
Arguments:
	stalist - Associative array of Station structures keyed by
		station name.  This is used to build the internal
		station column indexing array.
	arrp - Associate array of phase handles keyed by phase
		name.  

Always returns a pointer to a valid SCMatrix structure (object).  
If any problems happen this function will call die.  This would
normally be memory alloc problems, but it could also happen if
the stalist or arrp arrays are foobarred. 

Note the algorithm assumes the list of phase handles is all inclusive
and will create a matrix large enough to deal with every phase it
finds listed there.

/*This is an important function that sets the set of base station corrections
used as the bias term in pmel.  These base station corrections are computed
as the difference between travel times computed by a 3D calculator 
(This program actually has no concept of this directly.  It just uses
the 3D model as a reference.) and a reference model (presumably generally
a 1D model like iasp91, but it could itself be 3D really).  Note
that if the 3D model has any station corrections set they will be applied.
For the reference model (1D) the station corrections are set by this 
function.  This allows testing or application with a global set of station
corrections used as the 3D equivalent, but allowing the results to be
space variable when used with dbpmel.  i.e. you can, if desired, use
the same travel time calculator for the 1D and 3D case, but if 
station corrections are defined for the 3D handle they will be used 
as a global bias term.  Similarly, if this same process is done with
no station corrections one can produce a "unbiased estimate" meaning
the bias term is always forced to 0 everywhere.  Experience has shown
that although this might be conceptually appealing it generally is a
bad idea unless the reference model is very good to start with.

Arguments:
	pha - associative array of phase handles for 1D reference model
		calculator (station correction of these handles are set here).
	pha3D - same as pha, but for the 3D (bias) model calculator
	sa - associative array of Station objects with station location
		information (keyed by sta name).
	hc - hypocentroid location.

Returns:
	0 - normal, aok
	> 0 - count of failures in computing travel times 
	< 0 - total failure

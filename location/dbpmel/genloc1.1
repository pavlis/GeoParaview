#
#  This is a set of extensions to css3.0.  The entries here do not
#  stand alone as these tables mainly reference attributes defined
#  in css3.0.  These extensions would normally be used with the 
#  database descriptor as:  css3.0:PMEL1.0
#
#  These extensions serve three purposes.  First, the tables define
#  predicted values for measurements in the arrival table that 
#  are based on some earth model and a particular travel time calculator.
#  This should allow future software to not be burdened with matching
#  theoretical travel times to data.  That is, these tables can be used
#  to simply show the predicted value without having to recompute it
#  and worry about whether the results will be consistent.  
#  Secondly, they define extension tables used in the genloc implementation
#  of pmel.  Note this final element was added after the first two 
#  because genloc already looked for some of these tables and I (glp)
#  viewed it better to extend this schema patch rather than add the
#  mess of a long string of extensions in the database descriptor. 
#  Finally, it adds tables for dbpmel that relate to multiple event
#  locations and area grids. 
#
#  WARNING:  these extension can collide with other extension
#  schemas.  In particular, the reftek relations are stolen from
#  iceworm1.3

        Description ( "Earth model predictions of data associated with arrivals" )
        Detail {
                This table has information that connects arrival rows
                to predicted values of related observable based on a
                particular earth model.  It is keyed similar to assoc, but
                the attributes in this relation are all predicted values
                based on some earth model.  This relations can be thought
                of as a supplement to assoc that directly stores predicted
                values of observables rather than residuals.  Note that
                esaz and dip are azimuth and dip of the predicted emergence
                angle of a given arrival in the focal sphere.  esaz is not
                necessarily the same as that stored in assoc which is 
                conventionally the great circle path angle.  Similarly
                seaz and ema are computed from a model, not from simple
                spherical geometry.

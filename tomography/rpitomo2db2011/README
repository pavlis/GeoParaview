This program has the same name an older version without the 2011 suffix 
in the directory name.  This supports a new model format in the 
more recent version of Roecker's code.   The new format allows more 
flexibility in the grid definition. It is now effectively a rectilinear
grid, but I still treat it as structured grid.  Be warned this needs to 
be modified if ever used as a model for pwmig.

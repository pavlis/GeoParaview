/*  dbmwspec

Usage:
  dbmwspec dbin recipe_file [-s spec_dir -trim -po -jack -correct]

where 
	dbin - input db to process spectra for

	recipe_file - control file used to specify which phase markers
		are to be used and time intervals (in seconds) relative
		to these phase markers to use for calculating spectral
		estimates.  (format described below)
	spec_dir - directory to write spectral files to.  A new table
		for dbin is created through a modified schema description.
		This tables is called the "spectra" table.  spec_dir
		is the directory where the output spectra are written
		to.  DEFAULT= "./spectra".  File names of spectra are
		always constructed as dfile of wfdisc_X where 
		X="arrival" name (e.g. P, S, PP, etc.) 
	-jack - if this argument appears, jackknife error estimate of 
		95% confidence limits will be estimated and saved as
		output spectral files with pstype set appropriately.
		The computational impact of calculating these errors is
		not neglible, but is not normally overwhelming either.
		(default is to not calculate jackknife error estimates)
	-correct- if this argument appears, data are corrected for 
		amplitude using response functions.  Otherwise only
		calib is used.  By default this option is off and 
		only the calib correction is applied.  Note if response
		functions are not defined and this option is set, a 
		error message will be generated for each spectrum, but
		the program should blunder on without correcting any 
		of the spectral estimates for the detailed response.

New June 2001:

Usage: dbmwspec dbin [-pf pffile -s spec_dir -trim -po -jack -correct]

This routine uses the multiwindow spectral estimation method (also 
called multitaper method) using a fortran subroutine obtained from
Frank Vernon. This is a second generation program that is a descendent
of an earlier one called "dbspectra".  It differs from the former
largely in the fact that the algorithm used to handle the data is 
far simpler than the earlier program.  That is, here all we do is
join the wfdisc and arrival tables  (Note these are css3.0 schema
specific so this program depends upon css3.0) and process this 
join table.  The program process keys on phase picks so the basic
algorithm is for each line in the recipe file we subset the 
joined wfdisc-arrival table for the key phase and then just loop 
through the subsetted table.  

This program uses a modified css3.0 schema.  The modified schema has
an extra table "psdisc" that is used to store spectral files and associated
parameters.

I decided to have this program always take the view of "when in doubt,
throw it out".  Consequently, it will not handle certain cases very 
elegantly and just toss out the data.  Common real life problems it
will not handle are:
1.  if there are any data gliches in a time window for which spectra are
to be calculated (defined normally as full scale values) that window is
discarded and no spectrum will be calculated for that trace window.
2.  this code more or less blatantly assumes the data are already segmented
into event files.  This is not a stupid assumption since it keys purely
on arrival times anyway.  Thus it makes sense that if you can pick an
arrival time there should be some data within the window you specify.  
If the window you specify the spectrum to be calculated around is not
complete (i.e. the start or end time are outside a given waveform segment
specified by one row in a wfdisc table) that waveform segment will be 
skipped.  
3.  It is not totally clear as I'm writing this (I haven't debugged this
new code yet) how this algorithm will handle overlapping waveform 
segments.  This does happen with triggered data streams because of
preevent memory.  My assumption is that this can be handled by properly 
trapping errors in dbputv when the spectra are saved.  That is, if spectra
can be calculated from two or more overlapping waveform segments dbputv
will, I believe, generate an error.  REQUIRES SOME TESTING  

RECIPE FILE FORMAT

Any line beginning with a # is treated as a comment (warning: #
must be in column 1)

Data lines in the recipe file have the following format:

phase	sname	start	end tbw

where 
	phase = any valid character specifying a standard "phase" in
		the assoc time (arid)
	sname =	name to be given to spectral estimate from this time
		window in output data base.
	start = time (in seconds) relative to the measured phase time to 
		use as defined start of time window
	end =	end time (in seconds) relative to phase time
	tbw = 	time-bandwidth product to use for spectral estimatesauthor:  Gary Pavlis
written:  July 1995

Modified June 2001

Replaced recipe file by a normal parameter file.  Now use a pf tbl
with the same items noted above, but keyed by the parameter name
spectra_windows

Argument list changed also to reflect this.

/* Special function to fix problem with overlapping segments in spectral 
calculations using triggered data.  Sometimes retriggering led to overlapping
wfdisc segments.  We handle this here in a way that is not as robust as
it probably should be, but should work over 99% of the time.  The only way
it would fail is if the time window desired was fairly long and extended
outside the boundaries of the overlap.   In that situation the traces 
could, in principle, be glued back together, but in fact that kind of problem
should be fixed at demux time anyway.  

Arguments:  db - db view that must have been formed as a join of the 
		wfdisc and arrival tables and sorted by sta,time,arrival.time, 
		and wfdisc start time.  Results are unpredictable if this is
		pointed at any other arbitrary view.
	    sps - This stucture specifies the time window around the 
		arrival.time field.  It is used to be sure we keep the 
		most appropriate row of the table 

Function is void because the use of dbmark dbcrunch doesn't
create a new view so the db is altered in place.

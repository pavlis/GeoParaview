Attribute sname
	String ( 4 )
	Format ( "%-4s" ) 
	Null  ( "-"  ) 
	Description ( "spectral file type name" ) 
	Detail {
	    This field is a character string mnenonic for the time
	    window with which spectrum defined by this record is defined.
	    For example:  P1.0, S2.5, etc.
	    }
	;
 
Attribute freq0
	Real ( 15 )
	Format ( "%15.6lg" )
	Description ( "Frequency of first point in spectral file" )
	Detail {
		Most spectra have zero as the first frequency, but we
		need to add this field to allow possibility of starting
		at a nonzero value.
		}
	;

Attribute sscale
	Real ( 15 )
	Format ( "%15.6lg" )
	Description ( "Spectral scale factor " )
	Detail {
		Scale factor of this spectral file required to convert spectra
		to unspecified standard units.  Included to allow individual
		spectral codes to not worry heavily about scaling.  
	}
	;

Attribute psid
	Integer ( 8 )
	Format ( "%8d" ) 
	Range ( "psid > 0" ) 
	Null  ( "NONULL"  ) 
	Description ( "power spectra id" ) 
	Detail {
	    The key field is a unique identifier
	    for a power spectral estimate similar to wfid.
	    }
	; 

Attribute pstype
	String ( 8 )
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Description ( "Spectrum file type" )
	Detail {
		This attribute describes the type of estimate the file
		associated with this relation points to.  Valid types
		anticipated at this revision include:
		sp1c - power spectrum estimate from single component
		sp3c - total power estimate from 3 components
		clow - lower confidence limit
		chi  - upper confidence limit
		low - lower bound of ensemble of spectral estimates
		high - upper bound of ensemble of spectral estimates
		1_4  - lower quartile of ensemble
		3_4  - upper quartile of ensemble
		}
	;

	Description ( "Power spectra file header and descriptive information" ) 
	Detail {
		this relation provides a pointer (or index) to spectral
		files stored on disk.  This would normally be expected
		to be trace like data stored as binary floats.  Technically
		though this relation allows integer binary formats.
		Current code ignores this attribute.

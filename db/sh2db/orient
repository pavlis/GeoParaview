Attribute pchan
	String (8)
	Format ( "%-8s" )
	Null ( "-" )
	Description ( "Processing channel code" )
	Detail {
		This is a processing channel code that may or may not match the more 
common chan attribute.  It is intended most to denote  generic channel after resampling 
and/or coordinate reorientation.  The expected codes are Z,N,E,L,R,T,H, and 3C but the 
range is not currently restricted to these.
	}

Attribute pwfid
	Integer (8)
	Format ( "%8d" )
	Null ( "-1" )
	Range ( "wfid > 0" )
	Description ( "processed waveform id" )
	Detail {
		Comparable to wfid used in wfdisc, but this integer
		key is the primary index of the core processing waveform
		table and is used for association and joining of 
		ancillary tables created by all processing algorithms
		that use this schema.
	}

Relation orient
	Fields ( pwfid pchan hang vang meastype )
	Primary ( pwfid )
	Description ( "Orientation data for processed channels" )
	Detail {
		Many processing algorithms that work on three-component data return 
		time series that are not standard channels codes.  These can easily 
		be channels that are vector motion in some arbitrary direction.  
		This extension table is intimately linked to wfprocess.  The idea 
		is to provide a mechanism to provide orientation information for rows in a wfprocess table.

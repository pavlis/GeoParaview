This should be a general purpose code to resample data to a 
common sample rate.

It should have core routines that yield a resampled 
Time_Series object from an input Time_Series object.

It should have core constructors that define a resample
object.  

Unsure if this should be database driven or use the 
it to test the new mpi framework.  Probabloy should make
it a database program to replace dbdec.  

The recipe for decimation procedures should use a range
specification for sample rates.  e.g. 39 to 41 is treated
like 40 sps and we use interpolation to sort out differences.
This can utilize the map compare function like that I used
for the gap definition.  Should provide a fairly elegant a
and general way to define resampling.  

Will need an output channel naming convention.

Should do nothing to data that are already at requested sample
rate.

Handling multiple sample rates for the same channel codes is
going to be a problem.  For this reason the result should 
be to a completely new database to make name collisions
simpler to deal with.

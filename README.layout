This repository evolved from an earlier organization I used until 
January 2014.   This is my personal git repository for software.  
Previously the directory structure evolved beyond what worked in 
my original layout as I evolved into some new areas.  The 
second motivation for reorganization was a need to separate 
code that was to be released through github and code I maintained
only locally.   I did not want to maintain two repositories so 
I simply reorganized this one.   

For now, the key organization is this.   

public - contains directories that will be made publically available
on github when I am ready to do so
prototypes - is used to hold code that I wished to retain but which
were mostly relics.  Call it a place for older research code that 
either hasn't gone far enough yet for release, or which did evolve
to release but in a different form so I wanted to retain this original.
Code in this directory should not normally be compiled.

All other directories can and likely will evolve with new projects.

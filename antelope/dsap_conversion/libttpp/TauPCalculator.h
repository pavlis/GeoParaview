/*! \brief Travel time calculator using Bulland's Tau-P calculator.

This is a C++ interface to Ray Bulland's travel time calculator as
modified originally in the Datascope library and supported for years
in the Antelope package.  This is object is essentially a set of 
wrapper that simply use of the Tau-P calculators as an alternative
to the ttimes approach used in Antelope.   This object, however, was
produced because of a need to remove Antelope dependencies so 
the Antelope issue is mainly an ancestory issue.

This object is a concrete implementation of pure virtual base
class TravelTimeCalculator object.  The intent is to allow the
travel time engine to take advantage of polymorphism.  This is an alterative
to the ttimes approach in Antelope that has lot of very awkward constructs,
at least in the authors opinion.

/*! \brief Travel time calculator pure virtual base interface definition.

Travel time calculators are a basic concept in seismology.  This is a C++
interface definition to define a generic travel time interface.   The 
intent is we can wrap multiple travel time engines to this interface.
This can and hopefully will eventually include Antelope's ttcalc 
interface hidden behind this OOP mechanism.

Note the interface intentionally only specifies a generic phase method.
Most calculators will want to define simplified method for P and S phases.
I did not force this into the interface since there may be calculators
that may not allow both P and S for a given instance.

In contrast this definition is (perhaps) too dogmatic about 
requiring derivatives.   The presumption is if a particular calculator
is implemented that has cannot readily calculate derivates or
slowness vectors the required methods will be stubbed to just throw
and error if called.

This repository was extracted from my larger glpcode library August 8, 2014,
using this git incantation:
git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter public -- --all

It will now become the master for pwmig codes to be released that
do not depend upon antelope.   

Do note the older commit history before the files were rearranged 
was lost through this process.   If anyone needs to ever dig through
the old debris starting more than 10 years ago they will need to
consult the older repository currently tagged as glpcode.
